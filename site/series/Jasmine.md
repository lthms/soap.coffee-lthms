# Welcome Jasmine!

After three years of loyal services, I will gradually retire `mulan`, the VPS I
was previously renting to Vultr. It is to be replaced by `jasmine`[^disney].
`jasmine` is pretty much the same machine (with 50% more disk space, and
alledgly more powerful CPUs).

Contrary to previous installation, I firmly intend to document the
infrastructure and services I will install on `jasmine`. This is the purpose of
this series. I am convinced it will be useful for Future Me. But, how knows?
Maybe it’ll be useful to others as well.

[^disney]: Yes, I am naming my servers (and personal computers) after Disney
    princesses.
