# My Self-Hosting Journey

I have been renting a server for most of my adult life. It has been a wonderful
playground for experimenting and learing. My current server is a VPS called
`tinkerbell`, nicknamed as such because I picked the smallest (cheapest) Vultr
VM. Its predecessor, `moana`, was the exact opposite. Before that, I got to
experiment with `jasmine` a couple of months. `jasmine` was the successor of
`mulan`, that served me well for three full years. The list goes on[^disney].

Over the years, I have experimented with many approaches to administrate a
Linux server. From time to time, I did put myself in a corner by not
documenting what I was doing. Have you ever felt like you cannot reboot your
server because you are not sure to be able to put it back up online in its
previously working condition? That’s been me, more often than I care to admit.

This is bound to happen again, but I’ve decided that one good way to delay the
inevitable is to write about what I’m doing in the cloud. This is the intent of
this series. I expect the main benefitor from my articles will be Future Me,
but who knows? You might find some of these write-ups interesting as well!

[^disney]: Yes, I am naming my servers (and personal computers) after Disney
    princesses.
