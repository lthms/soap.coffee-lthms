Over the years, I have made a habit of learning new programming
languages, out of curiosity, and I intend to continue this way for the
time being.

- [[./posts/DiscoveringCommonLisp.html][Discovering Common Lisp with ~trivial-gamekit~]] ::
  Common Lisp is a venerable programming languages like no other I
  know.  From the creation of a Lisp package up to the creation of a
  standalone executable, we explore the shore of this strange beast.

- [[./posts/RankNTypesInOCaml.html][Rank-N Types in OCaml]] ::
  Programmers learning a strongly typed, functional programming
  languages like OCaml are quickly introduced to the notion of
  /polymorphism/ as a way to generalize types over types. Rank-N types
  are a class of polymorphic types that are cumbersome to write in
  OCaml, and we explore how it can be done in this article.
