#+TITLE: Monthly Retrospectives

For a year or two now, I have been aware of a trend consisting in
writing monthly recap in certain developers communities. I have
enjoyed reading these regular posts, and from time to time, I have
entertained the idea of writing my own. Never did I actually act on
this thought. That is, until today.  I anticipate the main audience of
this post —and hopefully the ones that will come afterwards— will be
future me, curious to remember what he was up to at that time.

  on this website (but not on Twitter/the Fediverse to be honest).
- [[./August2022.html][August 2022]], when I gave up on *~cleopatra~* and was able to
  generate this website in a few seconds again.
