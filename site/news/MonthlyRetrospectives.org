#+TITLE: Monthly Retrospectives

For a year or two now, I have been aware of a trend consisting in
writing monthly recap in certain developers communities. I have
enjoyed reading these regular posts, and from time to time, I have
entertained the idea of writing my own. Never did I actually act on
this thought. That is, until today.  I anticipate the main audience of
this post —and hopefully the ones that will come afterwards— will be
future me, curious to remember what he was up to at that time.
