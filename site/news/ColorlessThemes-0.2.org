[[https://code.soap.coffee/colorless-themes.git/tag/?h=0.2][I have tagged and released a new version of ~colorless-themes~]]. The motivation
behind modifying the version number is an important breaking change regarding
how the =colorless-themes-make= macro shall be used. Before ~0.2~, the macro was
calling =deftheme= and =provide-theme= itself. In practices, it meant the actual
themes were not using these two functions themselves. It was working great in
isolation, but it turns out many tools such as ~use-package~ or [[https://peach-melpa.org][Peach Melpa]] (an
auto-generated Emacs themes gallery) are relying on the presence of these
functions to decide whether a file provides a theme or not. As of now,
~nordless-theme~ and ~lavenderless-theme~ have been updated accordingly, and
[[https://peach-melpa.org/themes/lavenderless-theme/variants/lavenderless][they appear on Peach Melpa]]. Their loading can also be defered using the =:defer=
keyword of the =use-package= macro.

Maybe now is a good time to get in touch with ~melpa-stable~, and see if we can
add ~colorless-themes~ and its companion themes there.  Also, if you happen to
be a user of ~colorless-themes~, feel free to shoot an email! I would love to
hear about your experience using a mostly colorless theme.
