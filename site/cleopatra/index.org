The generation of [[https://soap.coffee/~lthms][my personal website]] is far from being trivial, and requires a
combination of —probably too— many tools. It turned out that some choices I have
made early on gave to the build toolchain I ended up writing a pretty nice
property: I could easily integrate its code to the very website it was conceived
to build, by means of [[http://www.literateprogramming.com/][literate programming]]!

The document you are reading is just that: the literate program of my home-grown
build toolchain ---called *~cleopatra~*---. The motivations behind this name are
twofold.

- I wanted to follow the example of [[https://soupault.neocities.org/][~soupault~]], named after [[https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippe_Soupault][a famous personality]].
- My main objective when I started working on this “project” was to be able to
  easily use whatever format I wanted to author my contents. Did you know that
  Cleopatra was a reputed polyglot (at least according to [[https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyglotte][Wikipedia France]])?

*~cleopatra~* is a literate program whose “program” part is working as
expected. Its “literate” part still requires some work, though.

  *~cleopatra~* is an extensible toolchain that builds a static website /and/ it
  is part of this very website. This means *~cleopatra~* is bootstrapped: it
  generates iteself.
