#+TITLE: About this Website

#+SERIES: ./index.html
#+SERIES_PREV: miscellaneous.html

The generation of this website is far from being trivial, and requires
the combination of —probably too— many tools. For instance, even if I
mostly use Org mode for authoring content, most of my write-ups about
Coq are actually Coq files, and I use ~coqdoc~ to generate the HTML
pages you read.

  This website could not exist without many awesome free software
  projects. Although I could not list them all even if I wanted, my
  desire is at least to try keeping up-to-date a curated description
  of the most significant ones.
