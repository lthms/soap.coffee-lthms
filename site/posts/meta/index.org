<h1>A Series on Generating this Static Website</h1>
#+END_EXPORT

The generation of this humble static website is far from being trivial, and
require a combination of —too— many tools. It turned out that some choices I
have made early on gave to the build toolchain I ended up writing a pretty nice
property: I could easily integrate its code to the very website it was conceived
to build, by means of [[http://www.literateprogramming.com/][literate programming]]!

This series is just that: the literate programming document of my home-grown
build toolchain, called *~cleopatra~*. The motivations behind this name are
twofold. First, I wanted to follow the example of [[https://soupault.neocities.org/][~soupault~]], named after [[https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippe_Soupault][a
famous personality]]. Secondly, one of my main objective when I started working on
this “project” was to be able to easily use whatever format I wanted to author
my contents. Did you know that Cleopatra was a reputed polyglot (at least
according to [[https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyglotte][Wikipedia France]])?
