~coqffi~ generates Coq FFI modules from compiled OCaml interface
modules (~.cmi~). In practice, it greatly reduces the hassle to mix
together OCaml and Coq modules within the same codebase, especially
when used together with the ~build~ build system.

- [[./CoqffiIntro.org][~coqffi~ in a Nutshell]] ::
  For each entry of a ~cmi~ file, ~coqffi~ tries to generate an
  equivalent (from the extraction mechanism perspective) Coq
  definition. In this article, we walk through how ~coqffi~ works.
- [[./CoqffiEcho.org][Implementing an Echo Server in Coq with ~coqffi~]] ::
  In this tutorial, we will demonstrate how ~coqffi~ can be used to
  implement an echo server, /i.e./, a TCP server which sends back
  any input it receives from its clients.
