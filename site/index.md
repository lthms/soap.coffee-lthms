# Hi!

Welcome to my little corner of the Internet.

You will find it dusty more often than not, but it’s been there for quite a
while now, and its contents might be of interest for you. If that is the case,
I’m thrilled!

## Projects

Here is a list of the free software projects I have most enjoyed writing, and
that made an impact on my daily life.

- [Spatial Shell](https://github.com/lthms/spatial-shell) (MPL-2.0) enables a
  dynamic tiling management a la Material Shell, for i3 and sway.
- [**keyr**](https://github.com/lthms/keyr) (GPL-3) lets you know how many
  keystrokes you have made since you have started using it.
- [`coqffi`](https://github.com/coq-community/coqffi) (MIT) generates the
  necessary boilerplate to use OCaml functions in a Coq development, and
  configure the Coq extraction mechanism accordingly.
- [ogam](https://github.com/lthms/ogam) (MPL-2.0) is a domain-specific markup
  language intended to free fiction writers from the pain to enforce
  typographic rules themselves.
