I may have some opinions on some topics, and sometimes I may want to share
them. However, I strongly believe facts and opinions are two differents things,
and even though I do not intend to write plain wrong facts, I prefer to keep two
separate indexes.

I would encourage you to use your critical mind while reading these write-ups.
